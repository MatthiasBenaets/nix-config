#
#  Doom Emacs: native install with home manager.
#  Recommended to comment out this import first install because script will cause issues. It your want to use doom emacs, use the correct location or change in script.
#  In my opinion better then nix-community/nix-doom-emacs but more of a hassle to install on a fresh install.
#  Unfortunately an activation script like with the default nix options is not possible since home.activation and home.file.*.onChange will time out systemd.
